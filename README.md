# Tidyverse-Assignment:
Create an Example Using one or more TidyVerse packages, and any dataset from fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle, create a programming sample “vignette” that demonstrates how to use one or more of the capabilities of the selected TidyVerse package with your selected dataset.

# Dataset chosen:

Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle

# Data Features:

**age**:age in years.

**sex**:(1 = male; 0 = female)

**cpchest**: pain type. Type of chest-pain experienced by the individual:
1 = typical angina
2 = atypical angina
3 = non-angina pain
4 = asymptomatic angina

**trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital).

**chol**:Serum cholestoral in mg/dl.

**fbs**:(fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false).

**restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results:
* 0 = normal
* 1 = ST-T wave abnormality
* 2 = left ventricle hyperthrophy

**thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved.

**exang**: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).

**oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

**slope**: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

**ca**: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.

**thal**: 
* 3 = normal 
* 6 = fixed defect 
* 7 = reversable defect

**target**: 1 or 0.
